# 20/27-minimal-ecommerce

This project is all about creating a very minimal e-commerce website. (this will
be front-end only project with very limited features, due to time constraints)

I will use [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) to initiate the project and
will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [jotai](https://jotai.org/) for
state management and for styling [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with
[daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). product data taken from
[https://dummyjson.com/docs/products](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products)
